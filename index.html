    <h2>This is an essay regarding the homeless and U.S. involvement in Israel</h2>
    <p>When I initially inspected this assignment, I did not know what angle to approach this
      project. Whether to focus on the people who have maintained the park as part of their day-to-day
      duties or through the parks environment.

    I want to bring to mind the atrocities occurring in the
      eastern shores of the Mediterranean. Thousands upon thousands of families are being broken up
      and slaughtered without remorse inside of modern day Israel or historically named Palestine.
      Those who survive are forced to seek shelter elsewhere and fear if they are next on the chopping
      block. This has made me realize their persecution also affects us back in the United States.In
      fact, since Israels violent “founding in 1948, the United States has provided Israel with over
      $130 billion in bilateral assistance focused on addressing new and complex security threats,
      bridging Israels capability gaps through security assistance and cooperation, increasing
      interoperability through joint exercises” (<strong><a href="https://
        www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-israel/#:~:text=Since its founding in
        1948,joint exercises, and helping Israel">U.S. State Department, 2023</a></strong>) yet have not made such
      an effort to provide us, as in its citizens, with as much promise.

      <p>After opening my eyes to such a
      landscape that allows for this to happen, I have came to the conclusion that I need to write about
      our own citizens who have no where to call their house, who get relocated by police and other
      city officials to “clean-up-the-streets”. My point of focus is towards a status of how these parks
      are mainly used and who is permitted to use them.
